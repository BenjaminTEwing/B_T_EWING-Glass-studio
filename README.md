# B-T-EWING_Mobile_glass_studio
 All of the parts and pieces to make an open source mobile or stationary glass studio.

## Introduction to this project
 The goal of this project is to fill in the gaps many people have when attempting to build their first studio, especially on a budget.  

 This is likely not be the least expensive possible solution, but my goal is to at least have it be cheaper than buying what is currently available.  Perhaps in the future this will also contain a seperate project that is the absolute most barebones method to get functional glassblowing stufio. 

 In each component of the greater project I hope to provide some context as to where it may be more reasonable for someone to purchase the suppliers and or tools instead of making them, while also providing the plans to make the tools themselves, should they have access to the neccesary supplies to do so.  Of course this is not specifically recommending and brand or individual, but instead is intended as a starting point for those not fully entrenched in the glassblowing community.
