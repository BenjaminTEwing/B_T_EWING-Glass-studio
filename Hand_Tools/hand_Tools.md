# Glass tools to buy/make

## Buy

### Waffle crimps

Graphite paddle - maybe sell

Round jacks 

Tweezers

#### Cane Marver
Frankly I'm sure there's someone out there that has the tools to make this on their own, however, I don't think this is very friendly to make yourself and when companies like steinert industries exist, making these yourself is almost entirely unreasonable.  That being said, it may be a project at a later date to attempt a cheaper form of a cane marver.


## Either Make or Buy

### Straight crimps
These are one of the tricky middle ground tools, there are some fun interesting ways to do this yourself, however, plenty of people would just rather just buy this than make it.  This would also require less common/more expensive tools in order to make yourself.

## Annealer
Typically I would suggest this being a make item, but if you can find a kiln on craigslist, then snatch that thing up and it'll work as a great annealer for years to come.  If it's a ceramics kiln then you'll likely need to add some controlability in order to be able to hold temp and slowly cool
## Make
This is my suggested list of handtools you should 100% make for yourself or order the parts to then make yourself

### Paddle
A paddle is one of the easiest things for an individual to make.  If you want it can be a simple plank, if you want something more traditional, pickup a coping saw and hack away some material to get a handle, a PDF is available that you print out a template if you want one of the more traditional shaped handles, but this tool is your own, feel free to customize!

### Parchoffii *Blades*
These are wood dowels.  They don't HAVE to been greenwood (*wood that's not dried out*) to function well, although some people definitely prefer greenwood.  The ends can then be rounded with a rasp/file/sandpaper; if you don't currently own a file, now would be a great time to buy one, they're not that expensive and are a great tool to have, especially while building your own equipment.
